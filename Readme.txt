### Time spent
8 hours

### Assumptions made
While building this project, my main assumption was that everything in the UI should be driven by the layout JSON. 
I didn’t want to hardcode anything—not even field labels or table columns. The idea is, the structure comes from the layout config,
 and the actual data comes from a separate API response. So when I render the UI, I just read from that layout—whether it's a text field, 
 group, or even a table—and bind it dynamically to the corresponding data. Even things like subtotal, tax, and total—although they logically 
 belong with the table—are treated as separate fields in the layout, just to keep things more flexible. This way, I can easily reuse the same 
 frontend component for different types of documents or forms without touching the code again.

### Shortcuts/Compromises made
I did take a few shortcuts and made some practical calls to keep the momentum going. For example, on the Google OAuth side, 
instead of going deep into refresh token flows and handling token expiration fully, I kept it basic for now—just enough to get authenticated sessions working. 
If the token expires, the user might have to re-authenticate, which is something I can improve later. 
Also, I leaned quite a bit on third-party libraries like Ant Design for components and styling.

### Stretch goals attempted
I implemented Google OAuth authentication, which added secure login capability using users' Google accounts. 
This required handling token management and ensuring session validity across refreshes. 
Additionally, I deployed the app to demonstrate a fully functional end-to-end flow in a live environment.
